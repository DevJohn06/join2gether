                    We use our own payment gateway to process payments. Doing this would mean ensuring that each and every payment is verified. For clients that have yet to settle their dues, we need to know if they are aware of or have authorized the payment. This is to reduce the risk of chargebacks. We will send a receipt of the payment via email.
